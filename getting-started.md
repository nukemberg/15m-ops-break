# Assumed prior knowledge
While you can use the videos without any prior knowledge, for best results you need some context and familiarity with the technologies involved. It is recommended you at least have some work experience with Linux, containers, some major cloud and other generic modern services. I will make an effort to explain the terminology used, but if it not explained or clear please look it up in the glossary or open an issue for me to cover it.

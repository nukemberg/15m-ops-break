# 15 minutes Ops break
This is the companion repository to the "15m Ops break" [YouTube project](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLohvP8p9jfOdyCoiJNjuc3iMz9ee9n_eF). The idea is to provide short (10-15m) video which touch subjects often not covered anywhere, with an emphasis on how things connect to each other and practicality.

The videos are currently in Hebrew only to make them more accessible (to Israelis ðŸ¤·).

## Who is this for?
The videos are targeted at junior to mid-level operations and software engineer - but videos range from extremely basic to somewhat advanced. Some assumptions on prior knowledge are made:
- Basic Linux tooling and concepts
- Basic networking and O/S concpects
- Practical experience in Linux based production systems
- Code reading (Python mostly)

However, if you hear some phrase you are unfamiliar with, that doesn't mean you're in over your head! The videos intentionally mention lots of concept in order to "connect the dots" and encourage further exploration.

## How to use this project
1. Go over the [Getting started](getting-started.md) guide
1. Watch a video
1. Practice by repeating what is done in the video yourself
1. Make a list of unfamiliar concepts
1. Explore further yourself
